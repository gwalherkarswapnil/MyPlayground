 3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations
 Medium

 Topics
 Companies

 Hint
 You are given a string s.

 You can perform the following process on s any number of times:

 Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
 Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
 Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
 Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: s = "abaacbcbb"

 Output: 5

 Explanation:
 We do the following operations:

 Choose index 2, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 3. The resulting string is s = "bacbcbb".
 Choose index 3, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 5. The resulting string is s = "acbcb".
 Example 2:

 Input: s = "aa"

 Output: 2

 Explanation:
 We cannot perform any operations, so we return the length of the original string.

  

 Constraints:

 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
 s consists only of lowercase English letters.
